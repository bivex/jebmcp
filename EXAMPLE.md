I'll help you connect to JEB and open the APK file to examine the Activity. Let me start by checking the JEB connection and then opening the APK file.
Ran tool check_connection
Great! JEB is connected. Now let me get the AndroidManifest.xml from the APK file to understand the structure and find the Activities:
Ran tool manifest
Perfect! I can see there's a main Activity at `c.k.a`. This is the launcher activity. Let me decompile this Activity class to show you its code:
Ran tool decompile_class
Excellent! I've successfully connected to JEB and opened the APK file `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Dev\jebmcp\k-release.apk`. Here's what I found:

## APK Analysis Summary

**Package**: `c.k`

**Main Activity**: `c.k.a` (launcher activity)

**Activity Code**:
```java
package c.k;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class a extends Activity {
    @Override  // android.app.Activity
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        TextView t = new TextView(this);
        t.setText(0x104000A);
        this.setContentView(t);
    }
}
```

**Analysis**:
- This is a very simple Android app with just one Activity
- The Activity creates a TextView and sets its text to a system resource (0x104000A, which is typically "Hello World" in Android)
- It's the main launcher activity as defined in the manifest

The app appears to be a minimal "Hello World" type application. Would you like me to explore any other aspects of this APK, such as looking for other classes, methods, or analyzing specific functionality?
